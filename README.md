# Hands-on_Lecture_2-This repository contains code to run Pasqual's triangle and the spiral Matrix.
Pasqual's Triangle is a pyramid of hexagons in which each hexagon is a combination of the two numbers in the hexagons above them starting at 1.
The Spiral Matrix is designed to read all the elements of a matrix of any length, and width, and return them in a spiral/clockwise order.
